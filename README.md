## Bit Camp by Bit Project
![Bit Camp Logo](/BitCampIllustration.jpeg)
## Our Mission

[Bit Project](https://www.bitproject.org/) is a nonprofit organization that helps students find ways to compete in the tech industry by providing them countless tech educational resources. We offer a free open source alternative called "Bit Camp," created by student developers in collaboration with industry partners, such as Microsoft, Twilio, Slack, etc. The goal is to teach students how to become more proficient in learning programming concepts and applying them to the projects.

As an open source organization, we want to increase community involvement and encourage more developers to contribute to our content. If you think any of our existing content is confusing to understand for beginners, too easy, too hard, etc., open a Pull Request (PR) and let us know! We welcome all suggestions and edits to our repo.


## Introducing Bit Camps

Bit Camp consists of weekly live lectures (hosted by student developers), assignments, office hours, and guidelines for creating a final project. Although mentorship and feedback are only available to students who apply and get into the boot camp, the curriculum is FREE and OPEN to all who want to learn new technologies and use their skills to their side projects. 

To find out more, click on the links below. Additionally, we also provide a syllabus in the **readme.md** to better understand each curriculum.


#### 1. [**GameDev**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/GameDev)

In this 8-week Bit Camp, you will learn how to make your own video games using Unity, a standard game development platform in the industry. You will start off creating a basic game, and then advance to include audio design and user interface.

#### 2. [**Javascript**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/Javascript)

In this 4-week Bit Camp, co-hosted by Twilio, students will learn the JavaScript programming language by navigating through TwilioQuest, an educational video game created by Twilio. Students will be introduced to using the terminal, setting up a local development environment, and basic programming concepts throughout the course.

#### 3. [**NoSQL**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/NoSQL)

This 8-week camp will be focusing on Atlas, which allows MongoDB to be developed and deployed in the cloud. Students will begin with the basics, setting up a database and then branching out to discover ways to analyze, filter, and create data. The last few weeks of camp consist of time to develop apply their newfound expertise and create a Web App with a MongoDB backend.

#### 4. [**Serverless-Functions**](https://lab.github.com/bitprj/creating-an-emotion-reader-with-azure-(face-api-and-http-triggers)/)

In this 8-week Bit Camp, co-hosted by Microsoft, you will learn about serverless architecture and functions, and why they are useful. You will utilize Microsoft Azure serverless functions, JavaScript, and external APIs to build and deploy your own app from end to end.

#### 5. [**Slack-Apps**](https://github.com/bitprj/BitCamp/tree/master/Slack-Apps)

In this 6-week Bit Camp co-hosted by Slack, students will be introduced to the Slack Platform and learn how to create Slack apps using Bolt for JavaScript. After setting up a basic Slack app, students will continue to add new features each week, including implementing third-party APIs and making use of Webhooks.
